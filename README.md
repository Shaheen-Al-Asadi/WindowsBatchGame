# WindowsBatchGame
Little text-based adventure set in a local dive bar in Toronto. Save as a .bat file in any text editor and run it.

Edit: Github is adding some sort of ^M ascii artifact in the script for some methods possibly as a safety precaution? Doesn't seem to affect the file however, can still be saved and run on any windows system.
